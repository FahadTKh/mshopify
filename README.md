<h1 align="center">🚀 Custom Shopify Theme with Dynamic Sections</h1>

👩🏻‍💻 I have developed a <strong>custom Shopify theme</strong> featuring <strong>5 fully dynamic sections</strong> built using <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Shopify Liquid</strong>, and <strong>Schema format</strong>. Each section is <strong>customizable via the Shopify Admin</strong>, allowing users to easily modify content without touching the code.

This theme is <strong>versatile</strong> and can be used <strong>anywhere</strong> within the Shopify ecosystem. Additionally, I have uploaded the complete theme to <strong>GitHub</strong>, enabling seamless collaboration and easy access.

Feel free to <strong>connect with GitHub</strong> to explore and integrate this theme into your Shopify store. 💻✨
